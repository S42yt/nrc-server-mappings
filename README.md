# nrc-server-mappings

This repository provides server mappings for the NoRisk Client, allowing servers to have enhanced icons, banners, and metadata displayed in the client.

## What is this?

- Supplies the NoRisk Client with improved server presentation: custom icons, banners, and descriptive metadata.
- Ensures all server assets (icons, backgrounds) follow consistent conventions for best appearance in the client.
- Contains scripts to validate and merge server manifests into a single distributable format for the client to consume.

## Structure

- `servers/` — Individual server manifests and images for each server.
- `merged/` — Output directory for merged manifests and assets (generated by scripts, used by the client).
- `scripts/` — Validation and merge scripts.
- `docs/` — Documentation for manifest and image conventions.

## Documentation

- [Step by Step Guide](docs/step-by-step.md)
